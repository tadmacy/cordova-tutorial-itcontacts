Extentions to the Cordova 3.x Tutorial with RESTful Authorization to Drupal
===========================================================================

Extentions added to the great tutorial bu Christphe Coenraets as found here:

http://coenraets.org/blog/cordova-phonegap-3-tutorial/ for instructions.

This tutorial that builds upon Christophe's work by adding the following:
authentication -  control access to data using the central AD/LDAP server for authentication
data - a CRUD repository for this data since it extends AD/LDAP schema (Drupal)
RESTful service to access the data (Drupal custom module)
